Sprint 2: Test Design and Documentation

Project 2: Task

1. Requirement analysis
You’ll be working with functional requirements FR-1 to FR-4, as outlined in the Urban Routes requirements document.
Task:
Decompose each requirement into atomic blocks and write them down in the Google Docs template that you set up earlier.

2. Test planning
Scan the test plan and fill out the table by writing down the number and the name of the section where you found the relevant information. 
			
3. Test case creation
Time to create your test cases. 
For this task, you will only work with requirement FR-4. You have already broken this requirement into atomic blocks, and you will be using them to write test cases.

Your task: Write test cases using the equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis and record your results into the Google Sheets template.


4. Environment setup
For your project, the environment has been set up by the Urban Routes DevOps team. The app runs on its own test server. When you’re ready, start the server and get the app running. DevOps have provided you with the following instructions:

Click on the “Start server” button.
It can take up to 2 minutes for the server to start up, so be prepared to wait.
A link with the server address may appear before all the server components have started up. In this case, when you click on the link, you’ll get a message saying “Try to deploy server first.”
Once all the components are up and running, you can click on the link or enter the application address in a browser.


5. Test execution
In the test execution phase, you get to run the test cases that you created! 
Your task: Add the results to the “Actual Results” column on the “Test Cases” tab of the Google Sheets file. There is no need to record bugs in Jira for this project.

6. Test closure
Go to the “Report” tab and enter the number of test cases you created. Then, add the number of passes and the number of failed tests.
